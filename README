This is a fork of sslscan.c to better support STARTTLS.

The original home page of sslscan is:

    http://www.titania.co.uk

sslscan was originally written by:

    Ian Ventura-Whiting

The current home page of this fork (until upstream merges a finished patch) is:

    http://www.github.com/ioerror/sslscan

Most of the pre-TLS protocol setup was inspired by the OpenSSL s_client.c
program. The goal of this fork is to eventually merge with the original
project after the STARTTLS setup is polished.
