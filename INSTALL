Requirements:
   OpenSSL 0.9.8o or better

Makefile build:
      make
      make install        (as root)

Manual Build:
   sslscan can be built manually using the following
   commands:

      gcc -lssl -o sslscan sslscan.c
      clang -lssl -o sslscan sslscan.c

There are two main ways to build a Windows executable.  The first is by using
MinGW or Mingw-w64 in a Windows environment.  The other is by cross-compiling
from Linux.  In both cases, it is necessary to compile OpenSSL to ensure that
all protocols and algorithms are enabled (note that some systems that package
OpenSSL have some deprecated features such as SSLv2 turned off for safety
reasons; we actually need those to test with). 


On a Windows build machine, to compile a 64-bit Windows executable:

   0.) Install Mingw-w64 from http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/.  Install MSYS from
       http://www.mingw.org/.

   1.) In an MSYS shell, compile OpenSSL with the following:
      ./Configure mingw64 -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 shared
      make

   2.) In an MSYS shell, compile sslscan with the path to the OpenSSL directory:
      make -f Makefile.mingw OPENSSL_PATH=../path/to/openssl


On a Windows build machine, to compile a 32-bit Windows executable:

   0.) Install MinGW and MSYS from http://www.mingw.org/.

   1.) In an MSYS shell, compile OpenSSL with the following:
      ./Configure mingw -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 shared
      make

   2.) In an MSYS shell, compile sslscan with the path to the OpenSSL directory:
      make -f Makefile.mingw OPENSSL_PATH=../path/to/openssl


On a Linux build machine, to build compile a 64-bit Windows executable:

   0.) Install Mingw-w64.  On Debian-like systems, this can be done with:
       apt-get install mingw-w64

   1.) Compile OpenSSL with the following:
       ./Configure --cross-compile-prefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32- -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 mingw64 shared
       make

   2.) Compile sslscan with the path to the OpenSSL directory:
       make -f Makefile.mingw OPENSSL_PATH=../path/to/openssl


On a Linux build machine, to compile a 32-bit Windows executable:

   0.) Install MinGW.  On Debian-like systems, this can be done with:
       apt-get install mingw32

   1.) Compile OpenSSL with the following:
       ./Configure --cross-compile-prefix=i586-mingw32msvc- -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 mingw shared
       make

   2.) Compile sslscan with the path to the OpenSSL directory:
       DEFINES="-DWONKY_LINUX_MINGW=1" make -f Makefile.mingw OPENSSL_PATH=../path/to/openssl
